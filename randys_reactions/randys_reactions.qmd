## Homework January 28, 2024

NICE WORK!  I really appreciate the effort you put into this, and the outputs show it!  Some notes:

* Keep those notes on date calculation, esp the 'lubridate' package.  Dealing with dates can be a pain, so I am glad you dug into this.  Thank you for including the URL.
* With your Scatter Plot work
    * again-nice work
    * I really appreciated the context at the top
    * I wondered how you got a negative distance ("-2")  I am guessing this could be an issue with directionality?
    * I am guessing it was rewarding to sort and rename columns-check out the janitor package sometime for cleaning up column names, etc.'
    * Note line 48-I think you meant to say "Leaf Mass"?
    * Beautiful comments
