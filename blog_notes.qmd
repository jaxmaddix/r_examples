##  There are three components to a Quarto document

1. The YML header: 
      * YML = yet another markup language
      * parameters that define what output will look like
      * can define table  of contents, etc
2. Prose aka text
      * you can make text  **bold**
      * make text *italic*
3. Code chunks

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r , echo=TRUE , message=FALSE , warning=FALSE}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
